   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running

To run the project in development mode, execute:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

API documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## üìÇ Usage

### üîß Environment Variables

To run the project correctly, you need to configure the following environment variables:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run (default is `3000`).
- `DATABASE_URL`: URL for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
- `ACCESS_SECRET`: Secret key for generating JWT access tokens.
- `REFRESH_SECRET`: Secret key for generating JWT refresh tokens.
- `AI_API_KEY`: API key for accessing OpenAI.
- `AI_API_URL`: URL for accessing the OpenAI API.
- `REDIS_URL`: URL for connecting to Redis.

These variables can be set in a `.env` file at the root of the project.
